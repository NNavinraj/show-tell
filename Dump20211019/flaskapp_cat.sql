INSERT INTO `cat` VALUES (1,'Cat','Ragdoll','The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a color point coat and striking blue eyes. Their form is large and muscular and their coat is silky soft and semi-longhair. Ragdolls were developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name \'Ragdoll\' is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.','12-15 years','They have a sturdy body, large frame, and proportionate legs. Their heads are broad with a flat top and wide space between the ears. They have long, muscular bodies with broad chests and short necks. Their tails are bushy and long in length, their paws are large, round, and tufted, and their coats are silky, dense, and medium to long length. Adults develop knickerbockers on their hind legs and a ruff around their necks. The breed is often known for their large round deep blue eyes','Much of what you can do at home to keep your cat happy and healthy is common sense, just like it is for people. Watch her diet, make sure she gets plenty of exercise, regularly brush her teeth and coat, and call us or a pet emergency hospital when something seems unusual (see “What to Watch For” below). Be sure to adhere to the schedule of examinations and vaccinations that we recommend for your pet. During your cat\'s exams, we’ll perform her necessary “check-ups” and test for diseases and conditions that are common in Rags. Another very important step in caring for your pet is signing her up for pet health insurance. There will certainly be medical tests and procedures she will need throughout her life and pet health insurance will help you cover those costs.','They think you are the most amazing creation (except maybe food). For this reason alone, they make excellent pets for first-time owners','Ragdolls are also extremely docile and don’t seem to mind other pets.\n\nThey get along with both dogs and cats, making them ideal for multi-pet homes. Some cats tend to get territorial, but not Ragdolls.\n\nThey’re happy to share their space and toys (with proper introductions of course). Even when confronted, they usually won’t engage in a fight. In fact, they’re so friendly, they often won’t even keep the mice away, so if you’re looking for a mouser, a Ragdoll isn’t for you.\n\nThough they’re docile, they also love to play.','','','Ragdoll'),(2,'Cat','Maine Coon','The Maine Coon is a large and sociable cat, hence its nickname, \'the gentle giant\'. It is characterised by a prominent ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an uneven two-layered coat with longer guard hairs over a silky satin undercoat, and a long, bushy tail. The breed\'s colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree. Prized for its intelligence and playful, gentle personality, the Maine Coon is often cited as having \'dog-like\' characteristics. Professionals notice certain health problems recurring in the breed, including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimise the frequency of these problems.','10-12 years','Maine Coons are known as the \"gentle giants\" and possess above-average intelligence, making them relatively easy to train. They are known for being loyal to their family and cautious—but not mean—around strangers, but are independent and not clingy. The Maine Coon is generally not known for being a \"lap cat\", but their gentle disposition makes the breed relaxed around dogs, other cats, and children. They are playful throughout their lives, with males tending to be more clownish and females generally possessing more dignity, yet both are equally affectionate. Many Maine Coons have a fascination with water and some speculate that this personality trait comes from their ancestors, who were aboard ships for much of their lives. Maine Coons are also well known for being very vocal cats. They are known for their frequent yowling or howling, trilling, chirping, and making other loud vocalisations.','Care for a Maine Coon by feeding them high-quality dry food 2-4 times per day. Their diet should include carbohydrates, vitamins, fats, and fatty acids. Groom your Maine Coon no less than once a week, to prevent fur from becoming matted. This highly intelligent cat breed adores human company, so spend as much time with them as possible. Encourage daily exercise and play to keep your Maine Coon fit.','Maine Coon cats are a great choice for beginners and first time cat owners. They are laid back, loyal, friendly and easy to get along with. Maine Coons bond with the ‘family’ and are good with changing environments if you move or add pets to the household. They need regular brushing and a higher protein diet.','Maine Coons are not high maintenance per se.\nThe two biggest issues you might deal with are their attention needs and the length of their coat.\n\nThe Maine Coon has a personality and a way about them that 1st-time cat owners will find easy to deal with.','','','Maine_coon'),(3,'Cat','Scottish Fold','The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant-gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to \"fold\", bending forward and down towards the front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an \"owl-like\" appearance.','12-14 years','The Scottish Fold is a sweet, charming breed. She is an easy cat to live with and to care for. She is affectionate and is comfortable with all members of her family. Her tail should be handled gently. Some of these cats are known to develop stiffness in the tail that can cause pain if it is mishandled or accidentally handled in a rough manner.','Scottish folds have dense fur and need regular grooming by brushing once a week for shorthaired cats and twice a week for longhaired cats. This helps to prevent hairballs.\n\nTrim your cat\'s nails every couple of weeks and provide a scratching post. Maintain good dental hygiene by brushing your cat\'s teeth at least weekly. Pay attention to your Scottish fold\'s ears and check them weekly for any signs of irritation, mites, or infection.','The Scottish Fold needs some interactive play with her parent in order to keep in good condition. While the coat is an easy one to care for, she appreciates being brushed as part of play.\n\nAs the Scottish Fold ages, play gently with the tail, moving it from side to side, and up and down. If any stiffness is noticed or if she appears to be in pain when the tail is manipulated, she should be taken to the veterinarian to make certain she is not suffering from arthritis.','Their personalities are one of the most relaxed out of any cat breed and are pretty flexible in their tolerance of different home dynamics. The Scottish/Fold Straight is rated a 10/10 breed for a cat in an apartment','','','Scottish_Fold'),(4,'Cat','Persian','The Persians are an Iranian ethnic group that make up over half the population of Iran. They share a common cultural system and are native speakers of the Persian language, as well as languages closely related to Persian.','10-17 years','Persian cats are a medium-sized breed and take their role as a loving companion seriously-they\'re always ready to be stroked and fussed over on a moment\'s notice. This beautiful kitty comes in a wide variety of colors and color combos, and they get along with all family members (including fellow furry ones) when introduced as kittens. If you\'re willing to put in the work with grooming-and it\'s a lot of work-you won\'t find a more loving companion.','In order for their luxurious coats to stay in top form, Persian cats require daily brushing to prevent tangles and mats. Brushing and combing will also remove excess dirt, dead hair, and even cat litter that might stick to their fur. Bathing is essential to keep your Persian\'s coat and skin in good shape. Pro tip: If you start bathing your cat when she\'s a kitten, she won\'t think twice about being placed in a tub of warm water when she\'s an adult. If you\'ve adopted an adult Persian, she might not be so willing to take a bath, so you might need to resort to spot cleaning with a warm, moist cloth.','someone who has the necessary time to spend maintaining their coat. \'You have to brush them every day,\' she says. If you don\'t, \'their fur gets tangled up. And if the fur gets matted, it\'s painful for the cat.\'','Persian cats are more popular than you might think. In fact, in the top 10 cat breeds for pets around the world. Many people want a Persian cat because of their looks and others want this type of cat because of the Persian cat personality traits. Either way, it can be difficult to resist Persian cats. They are adorable, loving, unique, and laid back. With this being said, there are some things that you might want to know about Persian cats before you get one as a pet. ','','','Persian'),(5,'Cat','Munchkin','The Munchkin cat breed is a medium sized cat with extremely short legs and a long spine. Munchkin cat\'s movements are described as being like that of a ferret, so it has not the feline grace of longer legged cats. Munchkin cats have a thick body with a well-rounded chest. The breed may have long or short hair. Both varieties have plush, all-weather coats with a silky appearance. The longhair Munchkin has a plumed tail. Munchkin cats can be in any colour or coat pattern and their walnut shaped eyes and can also be any colour.','12-15 years','This is an outgoing cat who enjoys being handled. He has lots of energy and is faster and more agile than he looks. Think of a low-slung sports car and you get the picture.\n\nThe friendly Munchkin likes playing with children and other cats and dogs. On the rare occasion when he’s not in motion, expect to see him sitting up on his hind legs to get a peek at something interesting. He’s not a “leap tall buildings in a single bound” kind of cat, but he is definitely capable of making his way to high places if he so chooses. It just takes him a little longer.\n\nThe Munchkin is highly intelligent. Challenge his brain by teaching him tricks and providing him with puzzle toys that will reward him with kibble or treats when he learns to manipulate them.\n\nAlways choose a kitten from a breeder who raises litters in her home and handles them from an early age. Meet at least one and ideally both of the parents to ensure that they have nice temperaments.','Keep your munchkin cat healthy with a good diet, fresh water, and a clean litter box. Make sure your cat gets plenty of attention. Munchkin cats are highly social. While munchkin cats don\'t require much special care, regular brushing is important to keep their fur free of tangles.','In short though, the Munchkin Cat is cute with a sweet nature that is growing in popularity and acceptance. It is almost exclusively characterized by it’s short legs, which have 3 subcategories of classification. It is not genetically modified as some believe, and owes its existence to a naturally occuring mutated gene. It’s been fully recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA), and is family and pet friendly. They are intelligent and playful cats, that are energetic, well mannered and outgoing, as well as being people friendly. They are an ideal indoor cat that comes in an endless variety of colors and will quite happily sit on your lap. Perhaps, most popularized by Paris Hilton, they nonetheless are winning over fans across the globe.','No matter what your eyes may tell you, the Munchkin is not a cross between a Dachshund and a cat. The dwarfed appearance of the low-riding feline is the result of a spontaneous natural mutation. Energetic and playful, the Munchkin might be short on height, but he’s long on fun.','','','Munchkin'),(6,'Cat','Domestic Short Hair','A domestic short-haired cat is a cat of mixed ancestry—thus not belonging to any particular recognised cat breed—possessing a coat of short fur. In Britain they are sometimes colloquially called moggies','15-20 years','TMuch like her color and pattern varieties, the Domestic shorthair cat personality spans a vast territory. Domestics can be playful, affectionate, quiet, vocal, docile, or calm—but are often social, points out Trupanion. She is not an aggressive cat by nature, which makes her a terrific companion for children and seniors, and, with a proper introduction period, she\'s a great playmate for cats, dogs and other pets.\n\nThe Domestic Shorthair is considered a working cat because of her endurance skills, such as balancing and leaping, as well as her superb hunting instinct. These characteristics are often reflected in her playful personality.\n\nShe\'ll need an outlet for all this energy, so provide her with a safe perch from which she can observe the great outdoors and practice her balance and agility skills. She\'ll want to keep an eye on the birds in the garden and on her pet parents in the living room at the same time. With her keen sense of surroundings, the Domestic also knows when it\'s a good time to curl up in the nearest available lap for an afternoon snooze.','The Domestic Shorthair requires minimal care and is not predisposed to disease or other illnesses. However, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals emphasizes that they may be prone to overeating, which can lead to obesity and the constellation of health problems related to carrying extra pounds. Choose a healthy cat food that will provide her with the nutrition she needs to live a happy, energetic life.\n\nIt\'s important to maintain a routine grooming schedule for your furry friend. Regular trimming of claws and brushing of teeth will keep your kitty in tip-top shape, along with regular brushing with a rubber or stainless steel comb or brush. In addition to yearly check-ups with your veterinarian, establishing a maintenance routine with your kitty from an early age will help make it a stress-free process for both of you. With proper care, the Domestic Shorthair cat can live up to twenty years.','Any cat loving family, families with children and other pets, singles, first-time cat owners','The World Cat Federation (WCF) notes that Domestics should have a balanced, solid body structure, with a head, nose, and ears that are proportionate to her body. But, as a trip to your local shelter will confirm, household cats come in many shapes and sizes.','','','Domestic_Short_Hair'),(7,'Cat','Exotic Shorthair','Exotic shorthair cats are a medium-sized breed with beautiful round heads, eyes, and bodies. Most will tip the scales between 10 and 12 pounds. Exotic shorthairs are a quiet and curious breed that is a bit more active than their long-haired cousins. ','10-15 years','Exotic shorthair cats are a moderately active breed so providing a cat tree is a great way to keep them stimulated. They also love toys, so provide a variety, possibly rotating them out every few weeks so your kitty doesn’t get bored. And, like most every breed, your exotic shorthair cat will love at least one padded window seat where they can spy on the outside world. You can also offer them a cat bed of their own, but because they are such lovebugs, it’s more likely your exotic shorthair will end up sleeping next to you.','Exotic shorthairs can entertain themselves pretty well since they are a medium energy breed. You won’t find your exotic shorthair cat climbing the curtains—you’re more likely to find them batting a ball up and down the hallway or snoozing on the couch. These cats are fine with other pets as long as everyone is introduced properly.','Exotic Shorthairs make ideal pets for owners who want a gentle, affectionate lap cat. They are a happy, healthy and mischievous breed. With an easily maintained coat they have quickly established themselves as both a striking show cat and a loving pet.','With their laid-back personalities and moustachioed face, the Exotic is one cool customer with a happy-go-lucky personality and sunny nature!','','','Exotic_Shorthair'),(8,'Cat','British Shorthair','The British Shorthair has a broad chest, muscular neck, strong jaws and a well developed muzzle. The legs are thick and strong. The breed looks like what she originally was, a cat that was to keep rodents out of the barn and the house.','14-20 years','The British Shorthair is a very pleasant cat to have as a companion. She is easy going and placid. The British is a fiercely loyal, loving cat and will attach herself to every one of her family members.\n\nWhile the British loves to play, she doesn\'t need hourly attention. If she is in the mood to play, she will find someone and bring a toy to that person. The British also plays well by herself, and thus is a good companion for single people.','Adult British Shorthairs require a high-protein diet with plenty of good quality nutrition and no empty caliroies. For a senior cat (seven years or over), this is even more important as they start to slow down','The laidback nature of the British Shorthair cat makes them well suited to family life, with children, other cats and cat-friendly dogs. They are equally confident when it comes to visitors. With an average energy level, they will happily play with children. However, given their bulky size, they prefer to not be picked up.\n\nIf you’re yet to experience the joys of having a feline friend in your life, the British Shorthair is an ideal breed for first-time cat owners. Their friendly disposition and teddy bear looks are sure to have you hooked for life.','British shorthair cats are a relatively low maintenance breed, making them a great choice for cat lovers seeking an easy going feline friend. Their short, thick coat will need a brush once a week, and they’ll love every minute of it.\n\nWhile we aim to please our cats, British Shorthairs love their food so it’s important to monitor portion sizes.','','','British_Shorthair'),(9,'Cat','Norwegian Forest Cat','The Norwegian Forest Cat is a large, heavily boned, heavily coated cat. She is a muscular and looks like the hunter she used to be.\n\nShe has a triangular head, set on a thick, muscular neck. The ears are medium sized and the chin is strong, but slightly rounded. The hind legs of the Norwegian are slightly higher than the front legs. The legs are heavily muscled. The paws look a bit oversized; they are big and round, and have fur between the toes.','12-20 years','The Norwegian Forest Cat is a sweet, loving cat. She appreciates praise and loves to interact with her parent. She makes a loving companion and bonds with her parents once she accepts them for her own.\n\nThe Norwegian has never forgotten her heritage. She is still a hunter at heart. She loves to chase toys as if they are real. She is territorial and patrols several times each day to make certain that all is fine.','The Norwegian Forest Cat tends to control her nutrition well, increasing her exercise and cutting down on intake when she feels it necessary. If provided with adequate play times and room to run and roam, she will not usually need to be kept on a nutrition plan.\n\nBeing territorial, the Norwegian likes room to make her own. She enjoys running, hiding and ambushing her toys. Perches and room to run should be provided.','The Norwegian must be groomed daily to keep the coat free from knots and tangles, especially during shedding season. This grooming can be incorporated into play time, but generally she enjoys being groomed. As with all thick coated cats, a hairball remedy may need to be given when regular shedding is occurring.','A strong, muscular cat, the Norwegian Forest Cat is also a loving companion and appreciates the praise of parents.','','','Norwegian_Forest_Cat');
