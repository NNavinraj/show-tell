Its name, Affenpinscher, translates as \'Monkey Terrier\' which describes this little dog very well. In the farmlands of Germany they survived by hunting rats and mice and so protected the farmers\' supply of winter food. The two World Wars nearly wiped out the breed, but thanks to some dedicated people it is thriving again.','12-14 years','The Affenpinscher is a quaint, comical dog that loves company, and loves to show off to their owners. They are eager to please, usually quiet and they will only bark if something unusual is happening within its territory. They are not really happy in a kennel, but will adapt.','The Affenpinscher needs little grooming, just a weekly comb or brush and a bath occasionally. You will need to trim the hair around its feet and keep its toe-nails trimmed, but they do prefer the scruffy look - this helps with the hair around the face hence the popular name \"Monkey Dog\".','Ideal owners are people who have small back yards and are willing to take them for walks. Once you have an Affenpinscher, it will finish up \"owning you\" and not the other way around.','For those people who do not have a lot of room, but still want to have a dog of their own that they can love then this smart little animal is well worth considering.','Small','HDB','Affenpinscher'),(2,'Dog','Afghan Hound','In the country from which the breed derives its name, the Afghan hound is regarded, though unofficially, as the \"national\" dog. Native Afghans also uphold the belief that the Afghan is the dog portrayed on the cave walls in the northern province of Balkh, which is why the Afghan has also been called the Balkh Hound. The Afghan hound is a sight hound, rather than a hunter by scent. It has exceptional vision and great speed, both of which were used in the hunt for prey.\n\nIts thick, luxurious coat protected it against the extreme cold of the upper snow regions, while also shielding it from the merciless sun as it roamed the desert. Its huge thickly padded paws and powerful hindquarters gave the Afghan hound equal ability to skim across hot desert sands or to scale rocky hilltops in mountainous terrain.','12-14 years','The breed is said to have a good, but aloof personality. These dogs are loyal and extremely manageable as adults, however, this is not to say that as puppies they do not have \"their moments\". On the whole, though, this is a breed that is extremely good with children, whether introduced to the home as a puppy or an adult, and it will adapt readily to the household routine. Afghans should never be off the lead outside their own environment because once the eyes spot a target, the ears \"switch off\".','Well-fenced enclosures are a must for this breed, as their keen sight will often get them into trouble otherwise. They require regular coat maintenance, bathing and exercise. They need appropriate feeding to cope with their growth patterns as youngsters and they should always have fresh, clean water available.','Anyone prepared to accept the dog\'s need for exercise and coat maintenance will be well rewarded with this breed.','If you have decided that the Afghan Hound is the dog for you and you understand that this is an animal that always needs to be well supervised','','',''),(3,'Dog','Airedale Terrier','The Airedale Terrier is the largest of the Terrier breeds. It was bred in the Aire Valley, in Yorkshire, England, from 1810 until the 1870s. The Otter hound was crossed with the now extinct Old English Black and Tan Terrier. This produced an intelligent all-round working dog, capable of hunting with the miners of the day and guarding the women and children when the men were at work.','10-12 years','This is linked to the dog\'s development. They are an all-rounder, possessed of sound temperament, great intelligence, and an instinctive desire to protect their family from any perceived danger. Airedales were used in World War I to carry messages through enemy lines and as police dogs and guard dogs. In other parts of the world they are used for hunting and retrieving. The Airedale\'s primary purpose is as a companion and family dog.','Airedale Terrier\'s have a hardy, wiry outer coat and a shorter undercoat of soft hair. This coat protects them from becoming chilled when wet. The hard hair also protects the dog from seeds or burrs. A good brush and comb once a week will keep the coat in good condition. Use a hard bristle or wire brush and a metal wide-toothed comb.\n\nPets are normally clipped two or three times a year. The Airedale does not shed hair continuously, but will after the winter need thorough brushing to remove the thick dead hair.\n\nDo not let your dog become infested with fleas and check for ticks regularly if they are in your area. The Airedale is an active energetic dog and needs regular exercise and play, including training. They are equally at home in a suburban back yard or a large property.\n\nBoredom may result in the animal digging holes or the removal of washing from the line and a garden hose lying around will provide much fun for a young dog.','','There have been Airedale Terriers in Australia since the 1890s, making the Breed well known. If you decide this is the breed of dog for you, ask yourself the following questions - do I have:\na) Secure fencing?\nb) Commitment and time to exercise and train the dog?\nc) The ability and desire to provide your dog with the human companionship it needs throughout its entire life?','','',''),(4,'Dog','Akita','The exact origin of the Akita remains unknown. Through skeletal remains and carbon dating, it was traced to 500 BC, although the Akita\'s specific breed history has only been recorded for the past 350 years. The Akita was also known as the Odate dog – named after the rugged mountainous area of Odate in the prefecture of Akita, on the island of Honshu.\nAs fishing has always been a major Japanese industry, the Akita, with its webbed feet and thick water-resistant coat, readily became the fishermen\'s workmate. Akitas were then used as cattle dogs, seeing-eye dogs for the blind, sled pullers and police dogs. They were also utilised as \'babysitters\' looking after children while their mothers worked in the rice fields. They first arrived in Australia in 1982.','10-12 years','The Akita very much personifies the enigmatic character of the Orient.A dignified, proud, and courageous dog with a fearless yet steady disposition which does not lose control when confronted with unusual or sudden stress situations. Even as a puppy it displays a certain dignity. It is an ever-patient playmate for children and a no-nonsense protector of family and home. Most of all, in the hands of suitable owners it is a joy to own.','The Akita loses its coat twice, sometimes three times a year and this is definitely something to consider if you are looking for a dog to live inside the house with you and your family. It requires extensive amounts of exercise and obedience training – this is a breed that needs to learn, from a young age, who is the \"leader of the pack\". When the Akita loses its coat, its fur literally drops out. At this time it is almost impossible to have it in the house with you so it is necessary to provide an outside fenced area with a warm, dry bed.','Those who accept the challenge and understand what is required to do justice to this breed will be rewarded with a loyal and loving animal.','Now you know a little more about the Akita and have decided this is the dog for you and you want more information','','',''),(5,'Dog','Alaskan Malamute','Alaskan Malamutes are big, powerful active dogs that have been bred for their ability to pull heavy loads over long distances.','10-12 years','Alaskan Malamutes are friendly, intelligent dogs that love people. Because of this they are not good guard dogs and cannot be attack-trained (although their size and appearance makes them an effective visual deterrent). They are, however, as strong-willed and determined as they are friendly, and must have obedience training in order to be under control at all times. If Malamutes make up their mind to chase something, they are frequently impossible to call back until they are ready to return.\n\nWhat\'s more, their friendliness does not extend to other dogs - especially those of the same sex. Malamutes can, and often will, take the opportunity to scrap with other dogs, and have been known to hunt down and kill other animals, especially cats, possums and farm livestock. They will also dig up gardens and plants with equal vigour.\n\nMalamutes are not one-man dogs - rather, they use their independence and intelligence to establish relationships with people they come in contact with, whether they are family members or strangers. These dogs make superb companions as they are anxious to please and eager to take part in an active and exciting life.','Alaskan Malamutes need a large amount of exercise and will take as much as you can provide. The mental stimulation gained through regular exercise is also important, as a bored Malamute can easily remodel your garden - good fences are essential.\n\nThese are hardy, robust dogs capable of enduring extreme cold, yet also able to deal with the heat of an Australian summer, provided that they are given shade, plenty of cool water and the care of an owner who is aware of the dangers of them overheating.\n\nMalamutes need surprisingly little food, being extremely efficient eaters. However, they will eat anything they can lay their paws on - having a survival instinct that leads them to believe that any meal could be their last. This breed also drops hair constantly, all over the house, car, clothes and furniture and they have a major moult at least once, sometimes twice, a year.\n\nPlease take note:\nThe breed\'s size and amazing strength makes it unsuitable for many people - these dogs are simply too powerful to be left under the control of children or the elderly. While the fact that they do not bark can often be an advantage, it should be noted that they have a daunting howl.','Unless you are a person who enjoys getting out and involving yourself and your dog in a wide range of activities, this may not be the breed for you. Likewise, if having a dog that likes to look you in the eye (usually by putting its paws on your shoulder) does not appeal, look elsewhere. However, for those people seeking a dog whose lovable nature and good looks is matched only by its intelligence and personality, an Alaskan Malamute can offer a lifetime of enjoyment and fun.','If you have decided that the Alaskan Malamute is the dog for you and you are prepared to have your garden \'remodelled\' occasionally by this fun-loving animal','','',''),(6,'Dog','American Staffordshire Terrier','The American Staffordshire Terrier is not a new breed. Although it gained American Kennel Club registration and recognition in 1936, it has been developed since the early 1800s as a result of crosses between the bulldogs of that time and game terriers.\n\nAlthough the early ancestors of this breed came from England, the development of the American Staffordshire Terrier is the story of a truly American breed. This dog was instrumental in the success of farmers and settlers who developed that country. They were used for general farm work, hunting wild pigs, bears, and other large game, guarding the homestead and for general companionship.\n\nA number of the early ancestors were also developed for the \'sport\' of dog fighting. The extraordinary vitality of this breed is a direct result of breeding for successful fighting dogs. This now illegal activity is, unfortunately, more often cited as the early purpose of the dogs rather than the general farm work, and although ancestors of the American Staffordshire were fighting dogs, the selective breeding since the 1930s has been away from the fighting heritage. The American Staffordshire Terrier today is a companion and show dog.','12-16 years','The American Staffordshire Terrier is a stoic and powerful breed. It\'s nature tends to be courageous and training is recommended.','The American Staffordshire Terrier is a relatively low maintenance dog, requiring minimal grooming of its coat, dry shampooing or bathing only when necessary and rubbing its coat will bring out a good shine. It requires daily exercise.\n\nIt will also seek and demand attention from its human family, but it will require training to become a good member of the family. A home with a fenced yard or kennel is essential.','','If you have decided that the American Staffordshire Terrier is the dog for you and you are prepared to keep this animal under close supervision','','',''),(7,'Dog','Australian Cattle Dog','The Australian Cattle Dog breed began evolving in the early 1830s through the need for a dog that could work cattle in Australia\'s harsh environment. The breed today is the result of many years of selective breeding. Five breeds of dog have gone into \'the making\' of the Australian Cattle Dog.\n\nFirst there was the crossing of the dingo with an English breed of dog, the Smithfield, and the progeny from these were crossed with the smooth-coated blue merle Collie (commonly referred to today as the German Coolie). These were then mated to the Dalmatian to put the love of horses and the protection of their master\'s property into the breed.','13-15 years','Australian Cattle Dogs are loyal, courageous and devoted and possess a natural aptitude in the working and control of cattle. They are suspicious of strangers and will protect the family and possessions with their life. They are not naturally aggressive, but if provoked they will not back down without a fight.','Even though the Australian Cattle Dog is a working dog, it does well in a suburban household as long as its exercise requirements (this includes mental stimulation) are met. Obedience training of Australian Cattle Dogs is a must, as their brain needs stimulation of the right sort so that they don\'t think things up for themselves – such as digging, pulling washing from the clothes-line, pruning trees, landscaping, and jumping fences.','The ideal owner for the Australian Cattle Dog should be someone who likes to have an active dog. While the Australian Cattle Dog absolutely adores children, similar to all breeds of dog it should never be left alone with them unsupervised. Elderly people might find that the Australian Cattle Dog is a bit of a handful.','If you have decided that the Australian Cattle Dog is the dog for you and you are prepared to properly train this loyal dog to get the most out of it','','',''),(8,'Dog','Australian Shepherd','The Australian Shepherd was actually developed in America, but there are many debates over the origins of the foundation stock. It is believed dogs travelled over with flocks of Merino sheep and the Basque shepherds who tended them. Some contend they came to Australia from Spain when the first Merino sheep arrived, and then travelled on to America. Others believe they were Australian Sheepdogs derived from the Smithfield and some type of Collie – possibly the German Coolie or its ancestor. The name came about because of the perceived link with this country and the herding of Australian Merino sheep.\n\nIn Australia the breed is in its infancy, only having been introduced in 1990. Australian Shepherds were fully recognised by the Australian National Kennel Council on January 1, 1994. Since then, the dog has gained considerably in popularity, competing successfully in conformation, obedience and agility.','13-15 years','The Australian Shepherd is good-natured with an even disposition. It may be somewhat reserved when meeting people for the first time, but there should never be any display of shyness or aggression. This breed is primarily a working dog with strong herding and guarding instincts. It is very agile and works with style and enthusiasm. Although not couch potatoes, some are quite content to be lap dogs. Extremely intelligent and devoted to their families, they are quick to learn and very easy to train.','A huge yard is not required for this breed, but daily exercise is a must.\n\nPlease take note:\n\'Grinning\' is a characteristic of some Australian Shepherds and is not to be mistaken for snarling.','The Australian Shepherd is perfect for the person wanting a highly trainable dog. If you have the time and commitment to take on an Aussie Shepherd, you won\'t be disappointed.','If you have decided that the Australian Shepherd is the dog for you and you are prepared to exercise this dog for at least 30 minutes a day','','',''),(9,'Dog','Australian Terrier','Proudly Australian, the breed evolved from a variety of British terriers that had been brought out to this country by settlers. Specifically bred for Australian conditions, this hard-bitten and tough little terrier was used for everything from guarding the farms and mines to hunting, and from tending the sheep to killing rats and snakes.\n\nEssentially a working terrier, the \'Aussie\' as they are affectionately known, soon endeared themselves to all those with whom they came in contact as a very desirable companion dog. Equally suited to town or country living, the Australian Terrier is noted for its loyalty, intelligence and even disposition. They are neither highly strung nor a persistent barker, but with their boundless self-assurance will happily take on the role of protector.','12-15 years','The Australian Terrier is an even-tempered dog, versatile in movement, good company for young and old as it delights in human companionship. Small and tough, it is equally at home on a farm or in a suburban back yard.','Brush its coat a couple of times a week as the brushing stimulates the natural oils in their coat giving them a high gloss. Bathe only when necessary. Minimum exercise is needed, but they will enjoy a daily walk or roam free in a fenced yard.','For those people who want a warm-hearted \'character\', this cheerful little dog would be the ideal pet.','If you have decided that the Australian Terrier is the dog for you and you want a cheery companion that is more than happy to accompany you on a daily walk','Small','HDB','Australian_terrier'),(10,'Dog','Basenji','The Basenji, Africa\'s barkless dog, existed in the early days of the Pharaohs, and in fact the breed is older than the Pyramids themselves. It was not until 1895 that Western civilization discovered the Basenji in the Congo regions being used by the various tribes as a hunting dog. Even today, they are highly prized possessions, as without these little dogs, natives lose their prestige as hunters.','\n12-16 years','Elegant, graceful and extremely versatile, the Basenji is fastidiously clean, easily house trained and completely lacks any doggy smell. Although the breed\'s lack of bark is often thought to mean lack of voice, this is definitely not so. In fact, the Basenji has an amazing vocabulary of sounds, and is usually uttered when the dog is happy, or caught in the act of being mischievous. The most common vocalisation is a mixture between a chortle and a yodel.\n\nAs a watchdog, the Basenji is more positive in its approach than the usual barking house pet - it will raise its hackles and let out an unnerving rumble at the sound of impending danger. It is particularly protective with children. In fact, the breed is said to have the gameness of a Bullmastiff, but with the gentleness of a Labrador. The breed can be disobedient if not trained correctly. It is, however, too intelligent to be forced, so do not try to break your dogs will. You must be firm but fair. But any dog-lover with the patience and tolerance to really understand the Basenji will be rewarded with an affectionate, lovable family companion that thrives on attention.\n\nBasenjis are known to cry real tears, climb trees, hug like bears, stalk birds, and will even clean themselves similar to cats.','These dogs are natural hunters, with the ability to make the best use of sight, scent and sound. However, these strongly developed hunting instincts can also be the Basenji\'s undoing. For instance, if a dog is busy following a scent but a car happens to get in the way, the dog will not see it - this has resulted in an alarming number of Basenjis being killed. For this reason, it is extremely important to have good fencing.\n\nPlease take note:\nBasenjis do have an independent nature and because of this can sometimes be hard to live with.','For those people who can meet the very specific needs of this highly individualistic breed.','If you have decided that the Basenji is the dog for you and you are prepared to live with an extremely independent dog that likes to \"lead the way\"','','',''),(11,'Dog','Bedlington Terrier','When you see a Bedlington Terrier for the first time you could be forgiven for thinking that you are looking at a dainty lamb-like animal. Their unique and stunning appearance is quite unlike any of the other terriers in the terrier group, and they were named after a village in Northumberland (England) where they were first bred. Despite their appearance, they were swift and efficient hunters of otters and badgers that their farmer owners used them for hundreds of years ago.','12-14 years','The Bedlington Terrier is a good-tempered and graceful dog with plenty of courage. It is thought that Whippets were bred with the dog\'s ancestors and to help develop its shape and the ability to run. The Bedlington is a good family dog that will happily attach itself to all members of the household.','Trim the coat occasionally to keep it spotless and looking smart. Training these intelligent dogs is relatively easy – particularly if a firm and consistent routine is established at an early age. Their Whippet heritage means they love to run to regular exercise is a must with the occasional bit of ‘off leash’ time so they can really flex those muscles.','This dog easily adapts to most people and their situations but is most suited to those with plenty of space to roam in the backyard and enough time for regular walks and runs.','If you have decided that the Bedlington Terrier is the dog for you and you are aware that it is an exuberant animal that needs plenty of exercise and attention','','',''),(12,'Dog','Bernese Mountain Dog','Ancestors of the Bernese Mountain Dogs were brought into Switzerland more than 2000 years ago by forces of invading Roman soldiers, and although they can still to be found on farms of central Switzerland today, by the end of last century the breed had degenerated to such an extent as to be unrecognisable.\n\nThe Bernese Mountain Dog was mainly used as a drover\'s dog and a watchdog in the farmyards in the Canton of Berne. Sufficient dogs of correct type remained for a rehabilitation program to be undertaken by fanciers and by 1907 a breed club was formed, and the breed found favour with many Swiss as a pet and companion.','6-8 years','This is a multi-purpose farm dog capable of draught work as well as being a kind and devoted family dog. It is slow to mature, but it is self-confident, good-natured, friendly and fearless and any aggressive behaviour should be stopped as soon as it starts.','An extremely hardy dog, strong, sturdy and alert, the Bernese is jet black with rich reddish brown on its legs, cheeks, spots over each eye, and on either side of his white chest markings. Its coat is of medium length and silky with a slight wave and needs daily grooming.\n\nPlease take note:\nBecause of the Bernes Mountain Dog\'s strong in-built herding instinct can quickly turn into a dangerous chasing habit if not curbed. Because they are tempted to round up any moving object, this can include traffic - so train your dog to understand that \'traffic herding\' is not allowed.','','If you have decided that the Bernese Mountain Dog is the dog for you and you are prepared to take on a strong and large dog','','',''),(13,'Dog','Bichon Frise','The Bichon Frise is a French and Belgian breed. Originally popular with the French aristocracy, the breed fell from favour during the French revolution. The Bichon Frise then worked for a living by performing with organ grinders and other street musicians.\n\nDuring World War I, the Bichon Frise almost became extinct and it was only the dedication of the French and Belgian breeders, which saved the breed.\n\nThe Bichon Frise was first introduced into Australia in the 1970s and since its introduction has proved successful in the show ring and equally successful as a companion dog.','12-15 years','The Bichon Frise has a superb temperament. It is an ideal companion dog, friendly, affectionate and enjoys contact with its human family. It should be primarily an indoor dog because of its devotion to the family. The Bichon Frise is not particularly suited to living outside.\n\nIt is always ready to play a game, take a walk, or just snuggle up for a cuddle. A breed with a wonderful attitude for life, they make an ideal companion for young and old alike.','The Bichon Frise requires regular grooming and is not a dog for those who want a \"no maintenance dog\". It requires regular brushing and combing (at least every second or third day) and needs to be bathed every two to three weeks. The coat does not shed so it needs to be cut every six to eight weeks. The Bichon Frise does not require a lot of exercise, but it loves to walk regularly and loves to run and play in the back yard.','The Bichon Frise is suited to anyone who wants a companion dog. The breed is considered to be \"non-allergenic\", by many people, and so may be the ideal dog for people with allergy problems. It is suggested, however, to visit the breeder and have contact with the dogs before purchasing to ensure that they suit if allergies are a problem.\n\nYou will not find a better dog than the Bichon Frise.

They were bred from the Talbot hound and the St Hubert hound, but have been identified as the modern Bloodhound since the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Bloodhound has the best nose of any hound and excels at tracking. It is first and foremost a scenting breed and will be persistent in following a trail, no matter for how long. It has been known for a Bloodhound to successfully follow a trail that was more than 72 hours \'cold\'. In America, Bloodhounds are used by the police for manhunts and have been successful in finding missing persons.','10-12 years','The Bloodhound is a reserved and sensitive hound. They rely heavily on their scenting abilities, and would rather \'smell\' you first before introducing themselves, but once they get to know you they are affectionate.\n\nAt home, they will let you know when you have visitors with their deep voice, but they are no guard dog. They will only \'give voice\' when there is a reason, they do not bark just to hear the sound of their own voice. The Bloodhound\'s characteristic wrinkles and large amount of loose skin can have its drawbacks, they do drool and dribble and will leave \'snail trails\' throughout the house.','Having a short coat, a Bloodhound is low maintenance. A good regular brushing is basically all that is required of the coat. The long ears can give problems with ear mites or fungal infections and need to be cleaned regularly. The ends of the ears should also be cleaned after meals.\n\nThey do need regular exercise and they grow quickly in the first 12 months so exercise with caution - as a puppy, Bloodhounds will tire quickly. The Bloodhound is not particularly adept at advanced obedience work, but they should be trained in basic obedience.\n\nPlease take note:\nThe Bloodhound is a scent hound, and as such \"the nose rules\" and so they will put their nose down and become oblivious to all around them and will follow the scent until its conclusion. This means they have no road sense and should only be allowed to run free in a secured area.\n\nThe Bloodhound has very few medical problems, but can be prone to bloat which is a serious condition and requires immediate veterinarian attention.

Brushing several times a week and bathing regularly will keep the coat clean and assist with flea control.\n\nA primary part of Borzoi care is the importance of regular exercise. These dogs need to visit open spaces such as parks or the beach, where they can be exercised \"off leash\". It is vital for the physical and mental wellbeing of this breed that regular exercise be maintained. Ideally, the Borzoi needs a large back yard, although this can be compensated for with long daily walks. As with all dogs, the Borzoi requires regular veterinary checks and lots of loving care.\n\nPlease take note:\nBorzois are agile dogs that need adequate fencing in order to keep them safely enclosed, particularly in the city. Similar to other large dogs, Borzois are occasionally prone to \"bloat\". Consult the breeder of your dog or your vet for additional information. Although this breed is quite capable of undertaking basic obedience training, it is generally not responsive to specialist training.','The ideal owner of this breed is someone who regularly takes their dog for long walks, but is happy to have a couch potato at home!

It desires human companionship and its character and individuality win it lifelong friends. It is very devoted to its family. The Bull Terrier has an innate sense of humour, brains, imagination, personality, and to those who love it – beauty. Its appearance, along with its character, is unique in the spectrum of dogs. The character and personality of the Bull Terrier is very complex.\nA Bull Terrier is very active and acts similar to a child and so you must be prepared for anything, and you must supervise it. Activity is a common characteristic in nearly every young Bull Terrier. All puppies are extremely busy and many Bull Terriers remain active and playful until well into middle age (5 to 6 years). A Bull Terrier will not do well in a situation where it is expected to remain alone in the home or yard for long periods of time.','A Bull Terrier sheds its coat twice a year. Loose hair can be removed with a daily rub-down using a special glove or brush. Nails and dewclaws should be checked monthly and clipped with dog nail clippers.

Horrifying accounts relate the animal\'s courage and tenacity in the bullring. Originally bred for the sport of bull baiting, which was popular in England for more than 700 years before it was made illegal in 1850.\nToday\'s Bulldog is a far cry from its ancestors. It is more heavily built and less athletic than those dogs that were used to torment the bulls.','8-10 years','The British Bulldog is usually placid and gentle, but can be jealously territorial around that which it regards as \"its own\". Its appearance, rather than its temperament, is its only asset if looking for a \"watchdog\". But it certainly has courage when called upon to defend its property. Its burly figure and massive head and jaw would undoubtedly deter any marauder. The Bulldog enjoys the company of its owner and displays a loving nature at every available opportunity. It is stoic to a fault. As with all animals, training and kind discipline should begin at eight weeks.\nIf a puppy is not discouraged when it jumps up on its owner, it will not be its fault if it is a nuisance later on. It is primarily as a family pet that the Bulldog scores well and it will repay you with many years of devotion and good health in return for your care and companionship.','It is recommended would-be purchasers learn a little about the breed before purchasing. A smooth-coated breed, the British Bulldog is generally a clean animal. Folds in its face need to be cleaned daily by drying them out with cotton wool, applying a petroleum jelly, and then wiping it out to create a barrier against tear stains and to prevent chafing.\n\nThe area underneath the root of the tail requires the same attention. And a little smeared over (and left on) the nose daily prevents it becoming crusty. Toe-nails (especially the dewclaws) should be inspected weekly to ensure they have not become too long and require clipping.\n\nDaily brushing for five minutes, and a wipe over with a damp flannel should keep your dog looking and feeling in top condition. Cooked bones should never be given nor any small bones that could become caught in the throat. Fresh clean water should be available at all times. A daily walk around the block should suffice for exercise, preferably early in the morning or late in the evening. These dogs do not enjoy getting overheated and great care should be taken to ensure that they are in a comfortable temperature at all times.\n\nPlease take note:\nAgitation, particularly during hot weather, can prove fatal.

The breed takes its modern name from the Duke of Newcastle\'s Nottingham country estate of Clumber Park, which is now a National Trust property and lies in the north of the famous Sherwood Forest.\n\nThe Clumber was developed to support the Dukes and gamekeepers in hunting this and nearby estates that were usually covered in heavy timber and very heavy undergrowth littered with fallen branches and limbs. The white coat ensured it could be seen in most scrub and its build ensured it could penetrate into the depths of that scrub and flush game hiding there or even retrieve shot game. The Clumber Spaniel arrived in Australia in 1883, the first coming direct from Clumber Park.','10-12 years','As with all breeds the temperament is generally the result of the way the dog has been cared for and raised. Overall, the Clumber Spaniel is extremely kind, thoughtful and easy to get on with. They have a deep-seated desire to please their owner and the owner\'s family, but cannot take the rigours of being forced trained or regimentally drilled; they need the opportunity and time to observe and assimilate how other dogs perform for their owners and will mimic this behaviour.\n\nThis heritage of working in the field is translated into a little independence, particularly when tracking, but they soon check their owner\'s whereabouts and will look to them for advice if the trail is clouded or lost. Their heritage as a field working dog translates into being happiest in a \'pack\' or kennel situation with a canine friend for company, and generally a Clumber is preferred, although they adapt well to other non-dominant breeds and so many individuals during the years have been ecstatically happy in single dog families.','The Clumber Spaniel is one of the most low maintenance of the spaniel family; from about 10 months of age they will need their feet trimmed every two months and from about 12 months of age the feathering under the ear hole and from the wrist to the foot on the front legs and from the hock to foot on the hind legs will also need to be trimmed every two months.','The Clumber is ideal for those people alert to a dog\'s body language and general health requirements, and essentially compassionate. The ideal owner will make sure the Clumber is exercised twice daily, groomed weekly, and trimmed every eight weeks. The ideal home will have a reasonable sized grassed back yard, with a smaller day yard set within the boundary.\n\nParks or good walks will virtually be on the home\'s doorsteps; and be inviting and interesting to the dog and to the owner.

The Dachshund is a unique breed in that there are three different coats, Long, Wire and Smooth and two sizes, Standard and Miniature. These varieties were each developed for a specific purpose, mainly depending upon the type of terrain encountered in their district of origin.Today\'s Dachshund in Australia and England is not normally used for hunting and is only bred as a faithful companion or show dog.','12-16 years','The Dachshund is first and foremost a sporting dog, but it is remarkably versatile – being equally adaptable as a house pet. The breed\'s temperament and acute intelligence makes them the ideal companion for town or country. They have retained a keen hunting instinct that is quickly brought to the surface at the sight of a rabbit or fox. Each variety is different in temperament. The Smooth tends to be more aloof than the other varieties and generally is very discerning in whom it likes or dislikes.','Dachshunds are strong, hardy and easy to care for. All three varieties require marginal attention, with the smooth variety in particular requiring very little grooming. This is obviously a big advantage for the average dog owning family.The long coat is the more glamorous of the three with long feathering on the ears, underline and tail, giving an appearance of elegance for those who prefer a glamorous coated animal.The wire coat is short and harsh to the touch and the breed is characterised by a beard and bushy eyebrows that gives the Wire its characteristic appearance. Dachshunds get bored hanging around the yard and are enthusiastic eaters, so ensure regular exercise or cut down on food. Dachshunds are quite happy to spend their life on your favourite chair, but for the dogs\' wellbeing, regular exercise is recommended.\n\nPlease take note:\nBecause of their long body in relation to their height, and the fact that most Dachshunds love food, it is important not to overfeed.

It was only in the early 19th Century that the breed acquired greater popularity, along with its rather whimsical name.\nIndeed, Dandie Dinmont was in fact the name of a character in Sir Walter Scott\'s 1814 novel Guy Mannering>, whose pack of six Pepper and Mustard Terriers were described so vividly.

The breed was known in England in Elizabethan times, although the modern English Setter was developed only during the last century. Used by hunters to locate upland game such as quail and partridge, the breed is enthusiastic when at work, having a keen game sense. In the field it ranges out from the hunter and on locating game, drops before it in a crouch. This instinct is still strong in lines bred both for the show ring and as companions.

Well mannered with other dogs, and loyal and affectionate by disposition, this breed is ideal as a companion for adults and children. English Setters are truly reliable in temperament, so thoroughly deserve the honour of being called \"the gentlemen and gentlewomen of the dog world\". A well-known television program places them in its Top Ten of recommended breeds. This is a dog that thrives on human contact, so English Setters will not take happily to being left to their own resources for long periods of time.','English Setters are active dogs that benefit from regular exercise. If they do not receive a daily walk and/or run in the park, they will tell you about it by either barking for attention or digging holes in the garden. Such behaviour is not specific to this breed, but is typical of any dog that becomes frustrated through lack of attention. Although a long coated breed, English Setters possess a silky textured coat that is easy to maintain. Brushing or combing for ten minutes twice a week is sufficient to groom the coat. However it is always a good idea to check for grass seeds or burrs immediately after a romp in the open. This way you will prevent coat tangles, and foreign bodies from entering the skin, eyes and ears. Show dogs are kept in show trim, with breeders always being prepared to help new owners master the technique. It is not necessary to keep a pet English Setter this way, but making sure the coat is clean, free of tangles, plus trimming away knots beneath the ears and excess hair from between the toes, will all make for a happy and healthy dog. Between baths, a sprinkle of talcum powder brushed through the coat will help keep your dog smelling sweet.\n\nPlease take note:\nEnglish Setters are usually good eaters, and if you are not careful, will lure you with their gentle, brown eyes into feeding them far too much. English Setters were bred to find game so they love running, and when they fix on a scent or give chase to a bird, they can become heedless to possible dangers such as the motor car and busy roads.

A Maltese is here just to give love and shower you with affection, to let you know who is at the door and generally just make everyone it meets feel happy and welcome. It is very intelligent and lively – and just loves to be pampered.','Maltese are definitely house dogs, and although they will find a securely fenced garden a joy to play in, they prefer to be inside with their owners. If kept in a flat or a unit a daily walk on a lead is desirable.Although Maltese make very glamorous show dogs, when kept as pets they do not have to remain in full coat – the hair can be trimmed back and shaped for ease of care. Daily brushing is essential to keep all the knots and matts at bay, and the dog will enjoy a weekly bath – but remember to blow dry thoroughly. A good bristle brush, a small face comb and scissors for trimming away hair from the pads of the feet are essential tools, along with nail clippers, boracic acid and a toothbrush for cleaning stained areas around the eye.\n\nPlease take note:\nAlthough this is classified as a toy breed, the Maltese still require normal exercise and an adequate diet to ensure they do not run to fat.','Anyone that is looking for a happy live-in companion will find this an excellent choice of dog.','If you have decided that the Maltese is the dog for you and you are aware that it needs a daily brushing to prevent matting','Small','HDB','Maltese'),(68,'Dog','Manchester Terrier','The Manchester Terrier is named after the English city where it was first bred. Sleek, racy dogs who possess a terrier\'s ratting instinct and the graceful contours of coursing hounds, Manchesters are spirited, bright, and athletic. They combine the streamlined grace of a coursing hound and the instincts of a fearless rat terrier. These racy dogs come in two size varieties: Standard (not exceeding 22 pounds) and Toy (not exceeding 12 pounds).\nAll Manchesters are similar in temperament, body type and athletic ability despite differences in size. They\'re easily recognized by a tight coat of rich mahogany tan and jet black. The head is long and wedge-shaped; tan spots above each eye point up a watchful expression. Manchesters can motor, running with good reach in front and propulsive rear drive powered by a muscular caboose.','14-16 years','The Manchester Terrier is a high-spirited, very intelligent, and cunning dog who is eager to learn. He displays the true terrier nature — independent, faithful, lively, sporty, and alert. Discerning and devoted as well, a Manchester Terrier makes a loyal friend and a terrific watchdog.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, there are two varieties of the Manchester Terrier — the Toy and the Standard. In their native England, however, the two sizes are classified as different breeds: the English Toy Terrier and the Manchester Terrier.\n\nEars are the other big issue for those who care to be official about their Manchester. According to the American breed standard, Toys must have naturally erect ears; cropping is not allowed. Standards have a little more freedom: Naturally erect, cropped, or \"button\" ears are all acceptable.\n\nAside from the differences in size and ears, Toys and Standards are the same dog with the same striking personality. Manchester Terriers are extremely loyal to their people. They crave notice without being overly demanding — there will be no pawing or begging for attention.','Your Manchester needs daily exercise and mental stimulation, a minimum of a half hour each day, including walks, runs, disc games, obedience, or agility. Hanging out alone in the back yard is not exercise; even if that\'s what you intended, your Manchester will spend the time waiting at the door asking to be let back in.\n\nManchesters have a great need for human contact so they are always happier when you\'re hanging out with them. When you\'re not playing with your companion, puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes are a great way to keep that active mind occupied.\n\nPuppies don\'t need as much hard exercise as adults, and in fact, you shouldn\'t let them run them on hard surfaces such as concrete or let them do a lot of jumping until they\'re at least a year old. It could stress their still developing skeletal system and cause future joint problems.\n\nManchester Terriers are clean, virtually odorless, and wonderfully adaptable, making them finely suited to living in apartments or houses, but less so to living outdoors. Manchester Terriers are not annoyingly active indoors; rather, most match their activity level to their owners, meaning that if you\'re a couch potato, your Manchester will likely lean that way too (of course, he\'d prefer going for a run with you).\n\nIf you have a tiny pack of Manchesters, they\'ll amuse each other and be a little more active indoors than if there were only one. In a single family dwelling, Manchesters should have a fenced yard.','Like many terriers, Manchesters have a lot of energy. They want to please and are quick learners. They are sensitive dogs, though, and can get snappy when they want to be left alone. This trait makes them unsuitable for families with small children unless the adults are willing to socialize and train their Manchester on a consistent basis.','Because of their short coats, they should not be left outdoors. When it is hot outside, their black coats could cause them to become overheated, and when it is cold outside, they can get very chilled.

Today they are bred as a superb companion and family dog.','6-12 years','Mastiffs are loving, gentle and extremely loyal dogs. Provided they have been properly introduced, they are usually very good with children, but, as with any breed of dog, there should always be adult supervision.\n\nMastiffs are sensitive and crave approval and affection. They love nothing better than to be with their owners and for this reason are particularly suitable and rewarding as house dogs.\n\nWhile not suitable as commercial guard dogs, Mastiffs will let you know when strangers are about. Their deep bark and massive appearance is usually enough to deter any unwelcome visitors.\n\nMastiffs love to please their owners but they are not a breed that will respond quickly or instantly obey without question.','Mastiffs are a low maintenance breed. Their short coats require only a weekly brushing and a monthly bath. They do shed hair and many slobber a great deal. For exercise, most Mastiffs love to lie about watching you exercise. However, they do need and enjoy a daily half hour walk, regardless of how big or small their property is. They do not cope well with warm weather so walking should be done in the cool early morning or late evening.\n\nMastiffs need very large amounts of food while they are young and growing but less as they mature. A fully mature Mastiff may not eat much more than an adult German Shepherd Dog. Fresh cool water in a large chew and tip proof container must always be available.\n\nPlease take note:\nMastiffs are generally healthy dogs and responsible breeders take every care to ensure the long term health of the puppy you buy. However, as with most dogs, problems can occur. Large breeds grow rapidly and they can be affected by bone disorders. Mastiffs can suffer eye problems and some have a tendency to be susceptible to bloat. If you are considering a Mastiff, discuss the breed with as many breeders as possible and with your vet.\n\nThe general running costs of a Mastiff are much higher than smaller breeds.

In a pinch, the Silky is happy to take his workout indoors with a rousing game of fetch in the hallway.\n\nThese are not outdoor dogs. The Silky craves the companionship of his people, and he\'s also small enough to be considered prey by wild animals. And despite his size, another risk is that he may fight with another dog who wanders onto his turf.\n\nWhen it comes to training, Silky Terriers make willing and able students. Because they\'re so smart, however, you need to be consistent; otherwise they\'ll be inclined to make up their own rules. The best way to win your Silky\'s cooperation is with fun lessons that use positive reinforcement.\n\nCrate training is the easiest way to housetrain your Silky, and crates are also a good way to keep your Silky safe and out of trouble when you\'re away from home. Silky Terriers are mischievous by nature and can be destructive when left unsupervised. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your dog accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.\n\nNever stick your Silky in a crate all day long, however. It\'s not a jail, and he shouldn\'t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he\'s sleeping at night. Silkys are people dogs, and they aren\'t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.','For the right owner, this fun-loving and energetic companion can add spice, and a lot of love, to life.','Despite the tough attitude, however, the Silky\'s a loyal dog who loves to be with his family.

They are close relatives to Wire Fox Terriers.\nSmooths are quite similar to their close relatives, Wire Fox Terriers. Like their crispy-coated cousins, Smooths stand no more than 15.5 inches at the shoulder. The distinguishing physical trait, besides coat type, is the head: A Smooth\'s head is more V-shaped than a Wire\'s. The dense, flat coat is predominantly white, with black, tan, or black-and-tan markings. These cleverly made hunters are strong and sturdy, but never coarse and clunky. Short-backed and symmetrical, they move with the unwavering grace of a pendulum clock.','12-15 years','The Fox Terrier was originally bred to flush foxes out of their hiding places during fox hunts. Today they’re primarily family companions and show dogs, although you’ll occasionally find them in the hunt country of the northeastern United States, still performing their traditional role.\n\nAlthough these are purebred dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.\n\nFox Terriers are highly intelligent dogs, and they have plenty of energy. They’d do best with humans who can provide them with lots of exercise and playtime, or else they might find their own ways to stay entertained with unwanted behaviors. Keep your pooch physically and mentally stimulated, and you’ll have a loving, playful companion.','Just because he\'s small doesn\'t mean the Fox Terrier is suited to apartment life. He really needs a securely fenced yard (think Fort Knox) where he can run off all that energy during the day. And don\'t count on an underground electronic fence to keep your Fox Terrier in the yard. The threat of a shock is nothing compared to the desire to chase what looks like prey — cats, rabbits, cars.\n\nKeep your Fox Terrier on leash when in unfenced areas. He has a strong hunting instinct and will chase anything that moves. He will also try to pick fights with other dogs, so he\'s not a good candidate for visiting dog parks. Early socialization is important to help prevent aggression toward other dogs.\n\nGive your Fox Terrier at least 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, as well as plenty of off-leash play in the yard to keep him tired and out of trouble.\n\nAlthough they\'re highly intelligent, they\'re also willful, so Fox Terriers can be challenging to train. Be patient and keep your sense of humor handy. They thrive on consistency and routine, so providing clear rules and enforcing them in a firm and positive way will produce the most progress. Once you\'ve unlocked the secret to motivating them, they can learn anything you can teach.','With their outgoing, self-assured personalities, Fox Terriers can get into lots of mischief, including raiding the kitchen table and breaking out of the yard. They love toys and balls, and many adore playing in the water. While Fox Terrier puppies are difficult to resist, be aware that when grown, they\'ll need a lot of attention and stimulation to keep them out of trouble. If you can stay a step or two ahead of them, though, they\'re lively and long-lived companions.','These are bold and energetic dogs that love to play with children. They\'re loyal to their families but impulsively scrappy with other dogs, never hesitating to pick fights, even with much bigger dogs. Unless they\'ve been trained and socialized to get along with other family pets, they shouldn\'t be trusted alone with them.\n\nFox Terriers have a lot of self-confidence and love to explore.

TMs can stand 26 inches at the shoulder and weigh well over 100 pounds. It\'s impossible to discuss this breed without leaning on words like \'powerful,\' \'muscular,\' massive,\' and \'substantial.\' And yet, TMs are quite light-footed and will meet a perceived threat with surprising agility. The broad head, with its high-set, V-shaped ears and expressive brown eyes, projects a noble, sagacious expression.','12-15 years','This still-primitive Tibetan Mastiff dog breed was developed centuries ago in Tibet. Originally used as guard dogs for livestock and property, Tibetan Mastiffs can still be found performing that role, but they also enjoy life as family companions and show dogs.\n\nDespite their massive, intimidating size, these pups are big softies when it comes to their human families. They retain their guardian nature, though, so strangers must beware, and introductions from trusted humans go a long way.\n\nDogTime recommends this big, spacious crate to give your big Tibetan Mastiff a place to rest and relax. You should also pick up this dog water bottle for any outdoor adventures you have with your pup!','The Tibetan Mastiff is a companion dog who should live indoors, with access to a large, securely fenced yard where he can exercise. A small yard or dog run isn\'t sufficient for his needs.\n\nHis heavy coat makes him unsuited to life in a hot, humid climate, although he can tolerate dry heat. During hot weather, he should always have access to shade and fresh water whenever he\'s outdoors.\n\nThe Tibetan Mastiff\'s exercise requirements can be satisfied with 20 to 30 minutes of play in the yard or a half-hour walk. He\'ll enjoy having another dog to play with, preferably one who comes close to his size.\n\nTibetan Mastiff puppies grow more quickly than smaller breeds, but they aren\'t physically mature until they\'re more than a year old. To prevent orthopedic damage, limit exercise to free play in the yard, and avoid long walks until your puppy is a year old.\n\nBegin training the day you bring your Tibetan Mastiff puppy home. They are intelligent and learn quickly, but their independent and stubborn nature means that strict and formal obedience training doesn\'t bring the best results.\n\nBe patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Tibetan Mastiff. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions.\n\nRegular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Tibetan Mastiff is more destructive and noisy than you can imagine.\n\nHousetraining comes easily to the Tibetan Mastiff. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your puppy from chewing on things he shouldn\'t or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren\'t around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he\'s feeling overwhelmed or tired. A crate should never be used as a punishment.\n\nLeash training is also important, especially since your Tibetan Mastiff will eventually weigh up to 160 pounds or more and be able to pull you where he wants to go. Tibetan Mastiffs should never be walked off leash and having good leash manners is essential to both the state of your muscles and your happiness.\n\nSocialization is a must for this breed. Not only can Tibetan Mastiffs be overly dominant toward other dogs, they tend to become overly protective of their home and family. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn\'t end there.\n\nVisit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events. Invite different people to your home on multiple occasions so your Tibetan Mastiff learns that others can come onto your property and his territory.\n\nWith the proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Tibetan Mastiff can be a wonderful family member who guards, protects, and loves you unconditionally.','Tibetan Mastiffs have a strong instinct concerning people, and if they don\'t get over their initial dislike of a particular person, there\'s usually a reason. Tibetan Mastiffs cannot be walked off leash and should be taken on several different routes during their daily walks to prevent them from becoming territorial of their walking route.','One thing is certain: if you do acquire a Tibetan Mastiff, your life is sure to be an interesting adventure with this beautiful, loyal companion.','Large','','Tibetan_Mastiff'),(88,'Dog','Welsh Springer Spaniel','The Welsh Springer Spaniel was first recognised by the UK Kennel Club as a breed in its own right in 1902.

Often named the most popular dog breed in various American cities, Yorkies pack lots of big-town attitude into a small but self-important package. They are favorites of urbanites the world over.

They can be difficult to housetrain, however, because their \'accidents\' are so small and easy to clean up that people let it slide. That\'s a mistake. It\'s better to show them where to go from the beginning and reward them for doing their business in the right place.

Contrary to most people\'s expectations and belief their coat is very easy to look after. Due to its texture, mud and dirt fall off or can be brushed out very easily. While it loves to play in the dirt, this is a fastidious dog that does not like getting dirty and, like a cat, will lick itself clean.

They\'re sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.','12-15 years','The Shiba Inu dog breed was originally bred to flush birds and small game, and was occasionally used to hunt wild boar.

He is an active breed who likes to play, take walks, or jog along with you. Giving him room to roam will help him get his ya-yas out.\n\nSocialization is important with this breed. Like any dog, he can become timid or quarrelsome if he isn\'t properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he\'s young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Shiba Inu puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog because he is suspicious of strangers and tends to be aggressive toward other dogs.\n\nHe\'ll also chase small animals such as cats or squirrels that run away from him, triggering his prey drive. For this reason, he should always be on a leash when he\'s in outside his fenced yard.\n\nOne quirk to the Shiba Inu\'s personality is his dislike of being restrained, even though it\'s required for his own safety. He doesn\'t like wearing a collar or being leashed. Leash training this breed takes time and patience, but is a must.\n\nPuppy and obedience classes are recommended for the Shiba Inu, not only for the lessons learned but also for the amount of stimulation and socialization it provides the dog. Work with a trainer who knows this breed. Don\'t be disappointed if the Shiba Inu is a difficult and strong-willed student — that\'s his nature. Think of it as a challenge.\n\nHousebreaking is relatively easy with this breed. Once your Shiba Inu understands the concept of where he needs to go, he will go to that area whenever he can. Crate training is a great housetraining aid that benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Shiba Inu doesn\'t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn\'t.\n\nA crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your dog accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Shiba Inu in a crate all day long, however.

The black coat is profuse around the neck, shoulders, and legs, giving the breed a silhouette that accentuates a thick, substantial body. The foxy face completes the unique look of a unique breed. If you can\'t tell a Schipperke from an ordinary dog, you simply haven\'t been paying attention.','13-15 years','Curious and clever, the Schipperke dog breed is often nicknamed LBD, for little black devil. They’re fearless and devoted, always on guard to protect their family from harm.\n\nEven though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.\n\nThe Shipperke’s small size and easy-care coat are attractive qualities, but their intelligence and curiosity can lead them into trouble. They adapt well to just about any home, even apartments, so long as they can get plenty of exercise. However, their independent streak can prove difficult for novice pet parents to handle. If you can give your dog patient training and physical activity while keeping a good sense of humor, you’ll be rewarded with a great watchdog and a happy, loving family member.','The Schipperke is an easy to care for and adaptable breed who should live indoors with his family. During hot weather, which he doesn\'t tolerate well, he enjoys lying in front of a fan or beneath a ceiling fan.\n\nHe generally does well in all types of settings and families, as long as he gets plenty of daily exercise and firm and consistent guidance from someone with a sense of humor.\n\nWith his high activity level, however, he may be best suited to a home with a small but securely fenced yard where he can run off some of his energy. Be aware that Schipperkes like to dig, especially if there may be a mole at the end of the tunnel.\n\nSchipperkes need at least half an hour of exercise daily, and more is better. Their people are usually tired before they are. They are always running and playing and will use your house as a racetrack when the mood strikes. Walk them on leash to prevent a sudden dash toward an interesting animal or object.\n\nCount on two daily walks to keep your Schipperke\'s desire for action satisfied. He\'ll also enjoy riding in a basket on a bicycle or cruising the aisles of the pet supply store in a grocery cart.\n\nBegin training when your Schipperke is young, and continue to reinforce lessons throughout his life. He requires a trainer who\'s patient and consistent and responds best to positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play.\n\nThe Schipperke is known for being stubborn. Although he\'s intelligent and wants you to be happy, his idea of how things should be may outweigh any desire to please. Some Schipperkes can be difficult to housetrain, and crate-training is recommended.','While he\'s incredibly cute, smart, and funny, the Schipperke can be a handful for a first-time dog owner. If you have patience, time, and a great sense of humor, however, you may find that he\'s the only dog for you. There\'s no doubt that with this little breed as a companion, your life will never be dull.','Give the Schipperke a job to do, or train him for agility, obedience, or other dog sports, and you have a well-behaved friend for life. Let him create his own entertainment or occupation and, well, don\'t say we didn\'t warn you.\n\nKeep the Schipperke in a securely fenced yard when he\'s outdoors. He\'s a notorious escape artist and oblivious to cars and other dangers when he takes it into his head to go exploring. For the same reasons, always walk him on leash.','Small','HDB','Schipperkee'),(97,'Dog','Scottish Terrier','The Scottish Terrier is one of the descendants of the old Scotch Terrier, along with the Dandie Dinmont, the Cairn, and the West Highland White Terrier. The exact origins of the breed is obscure, but a dog of its general description dates back to some of the earliest records. The low stature and wiry coat have always been important characteristics relating to the original purpose of the breed, which was to hunt and kill the various species of wildlife such as the fox, badger, weasel, and rat that made life hard for the early Scottish farmers and crofters.\n\nThe loss of livestock could well have made a huge difference to these folk, whose livelihood depended on the produce from their land, so a dog was developed which had exceptional strength and courage in a compact, tough package. These traits are still the hallmark of the breed today.','12-15 years','The Scottish Terrier is an adaptable little dog, which will fit in with most households. It is not always demonstrative with its emotions, however, its devotion and loyalty to its family are boundless. Although affectionate towards members of its own family, it is every bit the game terrier when strangers or other dogs are involved. If allowed, it will take on any dog, regardless of breed or size that invades its territory.\n\nWhile they can be extremely tolerant and good-natured regarding the antics of children, it can be cold, and even belligerent with strangers. It really prefers to be a one-man dog and these qualities make the Scottie an excellent watchdog.','The Scottish Terrier is an active breed and requires regular exercise, but its short legs mean less walking for its owner in order to provide the dog\'s daily requirements. The Scottie is not a good jogging companion, but makes an ideal walking companion. It is important that it is walked on a leash, as the dog\'s hunting instinct can entice it to run after a rabbit or a cat, into the path of an oncoming car.\n\nThe grooming needs of a Scottish Terrier will vary according to the lifestyle you choose for it. For a pet, all that is required is a thorough grooming with a good pin brush, followed by combing twice a week.\n\nPlease take note:\nAlthough the Scottish Terrier does not need the high fences required by some other breeds, it does, for its own safety, require secure fencing - particularly around swimming pools. This breed can become destructive if not given enough mental and physical stimulation. Make sure the dog\'s environment is hazard-free.','The ideal owner of a Scottish Terrier must have the time to devote to the needs of the dog, and a desire to share their life with a canine companion that will more than repay all the love and attention received. From dawn to dusk your every move will be watched and you will be protected and doted upon. As long as a Scottie is treated well, its love for its owner will be undying.','If you have decided that the Scottish Terrier is the dog for you and you realise that this dog needs plenty of exercise to keep it happy','Small','HDB','Scottish_Terrier'),(98,'Dog','Sealyham Terrier','In 1850, Captain John Edwardes, of Sealyham, Haverfordwest, Wales, set out to establish the breed which we know today as the Sealyham Terrier. Captain Edwardes was intent on creating a new breed which was small, robust, dead-game and not only intelligent but also of pleasing appearance. Though the combination of breeds that produced the Sealyham has always been kept secret, it is generally thought that its ancestors were the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.','12-14 years','Those fortunate people who have had a good Sealyham Terrier seldom want one of another breed in its place. A good Sealyham is meant to be good in character, health and looks. They are individuals and completely satisfying as companions in and out of doors. They make very good guards. They become devoted to their family of owners, they never forget a friend or a foe. They are most affectionate and return the love they get fully and joyfully.','No family should take on the Sealyham Terrier unless they are prepared to look after it properly and particularly looking to the coat care. Being white, this double coat needs regular combing with a strong wire comb to get right down to the job of keeping the coat free of matting. This little dog does not suffer with any major health problems.','','If you have decided that the Sealyham Terrier is the dog for you and you realise that its coat needs plenty of attention to keep it looking smart','Small','HDB','Sealyham_Terrier'),(99,'Dog','Toy Terrier','They started out in England as Toy Manchester Terriers, progressed to Toy Black and Tans, then to Miniature Black and Tans and in 1962 took their present title of English Toy Terrier.\n\nDespite its small size, it still retains the ability to hunt vermin, inherited from its Manchester Terrier forebears, and can be an excellent ratter. The Italian Greyhound is also believed to been used in its development and that could account for the more elegant, slender outline. The result is a graceful, well-balanced, compact Toy dog, with Terrier temperament and characteristics.','13-14 years','Sleek and richly coloured, the English Toy Terrier should always be black and tan, with the distinctive coat pattern laid down in the breed standard. A distinguishing feature is the candle-flame shaped ears, and the small, dark, sparkling eyes add to its alert expression. It is not aggressive, and is affectionate and friendly, making a charming, intelligent companion. It is an excellent housedog, giving warning of intruders before its owner is aware.','This delightful little dog is easy to care for as its short, smooth, odourless coat requires little more than a daily brushing. Although lightly built, it is quite robust, but having a naturally fine coat it is best suited as a housedog. Some may need a coat for outdoors in the colder weather. With its hunting Terrier background it is naturally quite active, and although it can manage well in a small garden or apartment, it will still benefit physically and mentally with a daily walk.\n\nPlease take note:\nAnnual checks and vaccinations are essential, as is regular worming. Your vet will explain the dangers of heartworm, and advise on the preventative measures.','It is good with children, but tends to be a one-man dog, so is admirably suited to single people, and older couples or families.','If you have decided that the English Toy Terrier is the dog for you and you are prepared to supervise it around any smaller pets in the home','Small','HDB','Toy_Terrier'),(100,'Dog','Jack Russell Terrier','The Reverend Jack Russell was very interested in fox hunting and saw the need for a small terrier to be used to flush out foxes that had gone to ground. In 1814 he acquired a terrier bitch named Trump from the local milkman which became his foundation bitch – and so the breed was born.The first Jack Russells were quite tall dogs (35cm) but during the years the breed has changed, and there are now two distinct varieties that are recognised as separate breeds – the Parson Jack Russell and the Jack Russell Terrier. There are three coat varieties, a smooth coat, a broken coat and a rough coat.','13-16 years','Jack Russell Terriers are great little hunting dogs that will tackle anything from a fox to a mouse. They spend a large amount of time investigating their surroundings and when taken for a walk in the country will hunt for hours. They are extremely intelligent and as a result, beginning to make their presence felt in the obedience ring.','Jack Russells make ideal house dogs, but are equally at home as outside dogs.\nPlease take note:\nThe inquisitive nature of this breed necessitates having good fencing in order to contain them.','Almost everyone.','If you have decided that the Jack Russell is the dog for you and you are able to provide a safe and secure back yard for it to play in','Small','HDB','Jack_Russell_Terrier'),(101,'Dog','Siberian Husky','At the basin of the Kolyma River at the foothills of the Cherski mountains, one of the tribes, the Chukchi people, went on to develop the Siberian Husky.

Their superb temperament makes them good family companions for people of all ages. As a breed, they are affectionate to one and all.\n\nInherent in the characteristics of the breed is an alert, outgoing and clownish personality. The dog\'s desire to please, coupled with its inclination to be stubborn and strong-willed, with unrivalled independence, is perhaps a carry-over from its working heritage. Each Siberian has a nature and identity of its own.','Without regular exercise a Siberian will become a nuisance, doing anything to alleviate boredom. These dogs will regulate their food intake. They have a naturally slow metabolism and need exercise to simulate their appetite. There is nothing as unsightly as an obese Siberian Husky.\n\nWhile many breeds moult with the seasons, in the Siberian the entire undercoat of the dog comes out in clumps, much like sheep\'s wool. Siberian Huskies are extremely energetic and with a great desire to run. An understanding of their heritage and use should give you a good indication of their exercise requirements. Siberians do well in sledding activities, which provide a much-needed outlet for their energy.\n\nPlease take note:\nWith this breed there are a few things to bear in mind; namely the potential for chasing and killing livestock, plus the breed\'s generally independent demeanour. These dogs don\'t bark a lot - but their song of joy can be noisy.','The Siberian Husky is not the ideal breed for everybody, but for those who are prepared to supply the exercise and companionship this breed requires, owning a Siberian can be a richly rewarding experience.','If you have decided that the Siberian Husky is the dog for you and you realise that plenty of strong exercise is needed to keep it happy and alert','Large','','Siberian_husky'),(102,'Dog','West Highland Terrier','The West Highland White Terrier or \"Westie\" as they are affectionately known, is a member of the small group of Scottish National Breeds that includes the Scottish Terrier and also the Cairn, from which the Westie originated. Until the early 19th century Terriers tended to be dark in colour and it was not uncommon for hunters to mistake a brown terrier for a fox and shoot it by mistake.\n\nSo the lightest coloured puppies of future litters were then kept in a bid to avoid these shooting accidents. These white terriers were then used to control vermin, including foxes and hares. They became known as the West Highland White Terrier in the first part of the 20th century.','12-16 years','Westies possess the classic terrier temperament; they are active, alert, game and full of self-importance. It does need pampering, and this hardy breed enjoys scampering about in all weather types and will follow its owners just about anywhere. They are extremely faithful, but do have a stubborn streak and so early training is essential.\n\nBarking is a natural behaviour for Terrier Breeds and the Westie is no exception.','This is a no wash-and-wear dog. Show dogs are trimmed by hand, plucking the coat with finger and thumb. Westies need to be trimmed at regular intervals (usually every three to four months) to remain presentable. Owners must keep up the combing and brushing, preferably daily. This brushing removes any dead hair and helps keep the coat clean.\n\nPlease take note:\nUnlike most other breeds, Westies do not moult in the normal way - they do not shed hair and therefore some asthma sufferers are able to live with a Westie when they have been unable to tolerate other breeds.\n\nAs the Westie was bred to be an earth dog, it can be a great digger if not taught at an early age that they must not dig in your favourite flower bed.','The Westie makes an ideal family pet as they are a great lover of human company. The Westie has a built-in sense of fun and adventure and enjoys exercise, whether it be a long country hike or a short trot around the block.

Few Shelties are used today for their original purpose as sheep dogs, but those people who have worked them vouch for their incredible stamina and instinctive ability to herd. They were first introduced into Australia in 1936. Often referred to as a miniature Collie, the Shetland Sheep dog certainly has the overall appearance of the Rough Collie, however, it is a breed in its own right and possesses some minor distinguishing features, apart from the obvious size difference.','12-13 years','Although rather a small dog, the Shetland Sheep dog is certainly not fragile. When feed was in short supply on the farms, the original Shelties were ferried on to small outlying islands with a flock of sheep and left for long periods to guard the flock and fend for themselves. Only the hardy would have been able to survive. When brought back to the farms after such isolation, the dogs would thrive on attention and affection. It is probably this part of their history that makes them so devoted to their owners, but suspicious of intruders and intent on protecting the family.','The Shetland Sheep dog\'s glamorous jacket requires surprisingly little attention. A brush and a comb behind the ears each week will keep it in good condition. The breed\'s double coat enables it to adapt to both hot and cold weather, the second layer (undercoat) giving insulation against both heat and cold.\n\nPlease take note:\nWhile the Shetland Sheep dog is certainly capable of barking, it is also smart enough to be trained not to bark unnecessarily.

The large, short-muzzled head is a wider-than-long \'envelope shaped\' rectangle, and the eyes are large, dark, and sparkly. A unique feature of Pekes is their effortless \'rolling\' gait. Pekes are charming, confident companions who develop a tight bond with their favorite human. Bred to live in palaces, they can be as serenely independent as the emperors who owned them. (They\'re \'opinionated,\' Peke people say.) Ever alert, they make good watchdogs. Pekes will tolerate kids but won\'t stand for a lot of roughhousing.','12-15 years','Pekingese dogs were bred for centuries to be the cherished companions of the imperial family of China.

Despite their heavy coat, Pekingese are housedogs and should not live outdoors. Their short noses make them sensitive to heat, so they need to live in an air-conditioned environment.\n\nPekes are stubborn and can be difficult to train. They won\'t respond at all to harsh corrections or training methods.

The Peke won\'t tolerate being grabbed or poked and won\'t hesitate to defend himself. Always supervise any interaction between a Pekingese and a child of any age.','If you are looking for a devoted, loving friend who will treat you with respect and dignity and expect the same treatment from you, then the Pekingese may be a breed to consider.
